Course : Computer Vision

Problem Statement : Robust detection and state estimation of traffic signals

Application : Perception modules for autonomous drive assist systems

Approach : 
 * Extracted image features using SIFT & SURF feature detectors, Hough transforms and dynamic thresholding to locate the traffic signals in image frames

* Integrated Deep Neural Network based object detection method YOLOV3 to improve robustness of detection and SVM for status recognition

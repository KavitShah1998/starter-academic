Course : Robot Navigation

Problem Statement : To implement and compare different SLAM techniques for indoor mapping

About the project : 

* Implemented different 3d SLAM techniques in ROS and Gazebo such as RTAB-Map which incorporates use of appearance-based loop closure detector

* Implemented 2d SLAM technique such as gmapping which employs the use of Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for estimating robot pose based on laser range data
